    "### Why not Deep-learning: \n",
    "    We have very small amount of data and LSTMs are not good with small amount of data, Hence need to use Linear Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Preprocessing \n",
    "    * Create one csv file which stores all files(particularly all rows from each file) from **labeled_articles** folder (__PreprocessedCSV.csv__ will be generated after executing cell[1] contaning all rows     \n",
    "    * To remove __####Abstract__ and __####Introduction__ from original text files, convert csv file to pandas dataframe and remove those rows using pandas\n",
    "    * Remove whitespace from the column **label** as some of the columns contain 'OWNX' and 'OWNX ', therefore consider this as two different classes.\n",
    "    * Cleaning the data by using regex \n",
    "    * Collect stopwords from stopwords.txt file given in the data and store it in **stopword list** (Later will be used as input parameter to CountVectorizer)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Tfidf features followed by SVM multiclass classification(oneVsOther)\n",
    "    * Store sentences data from pandas dataframe to __X__ and labels to __y__ and convert them to numpy vectors\n",
    "    * Split data into training and testing with 80:20 ratio and set any random seed value so that we can produce the same result with exact same accuracy and weights\n",
    "    * Create a model having pipeline of CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, LinearSVC functions\n",
    "    * Perform GridSearch to find optimum parameter for training the data\n",
    "    * Provide the optimum parameter and train the model \n",
    "    * Plot Confusion matrix and accuracy score\n",
    "    * Save the model so that it can be used directly again on this dataset\n",
    "    * Test the model with inputing any sentence given from any files of **unlabeled_articles** folder \n"
